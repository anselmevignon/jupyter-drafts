    "- Dataset\n",
    " - features are attributes ==> need to figure out what they could be, and how to interpret each of them\n",
    " - Each point is a date/device_id. Need to determine the sparsity in both dimensions, to know which modelisation could make sense. \n",
    " - is there a feature bias linked to the moment a maitenance occurs ? (e.g. no more data after a failure) this could build a bias in the data.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Problem\n",
    " - Failure detection: two signal axis (which device fails, when does a device fail ) to consider. Consider mixing two models ? eg:\n",
    "   - model1 : which device is the most likely to require maintenance.\n",
    "   - model2 : based on past signals, when is a maintenance the most likely to occur. \n",
    " - Failure detection: positives could be sparse. to be checked. SVD could be worth something\n",
    "  This is a precision/recall problem. \n",
    " - On the other hand, no obvious advantage in detecting a false positive over a false negative.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Infos\n",
    " - 3D technologies is electronics, the device sends out telemetry: multiple failure modes ( wrong telemetry, bad transmition, etc...) ==> we could be detecting multiple failure modes. ensemble models ?"
